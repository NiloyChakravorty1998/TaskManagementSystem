# TaskManagementSystem
Task Management System allows you to create / update and delete tasks. 

Project Title: "Task Management System"

Description:
The Task Management System is a web application that allows users to create, manage, and track tasks. It utilizes Spring Boot for the backend API development, React for the frontend interface, and JWT for secure user authentication and authorization.

Features:

User Registration and Authentication:

Users can register an account by providing their email and password.
User authentication is implemented using JWT tokens.
Passwords are securely hashed and stored in the database.
User Login and Token Generation:

Users can log in using their registered credentials.
Upon successful login, the server generates a JWT token and sends it back to the client.
The client stores the JWT token securely (e.g., in local storage or cookies) for subsequent API requests.
Task Creation and Management:

Authenticated users can create new tasks by providing a title, description, and due date.
Users can view, update, and delete their own tasks.
Tasks are associated with the user who created them.
Task Filtering and Sorting:

Users can filter tasks based on criteria such as status (completed/incomplete) or due date.
Sorting options can be provided to order tasks based on various attributes (e.g., due date, priority).
Role-Based Access Control:

Users can have different roles (e.g., regular user, admin) with varying levels of access.
Certain actions, such as task deletion or user management, may require elevated privileges.
JWT Token Validation and Authorization:

The server verifies the authenticity and validity of JWT tokens for each API request.
Users' roles and permissions are stored in the JWT payload and used for authorization checks.
Certain API endpoints can be restricted to specific roles or authenticated users only.
Error Handling and Exception Responses:

Custom error handling is implemented to provide meaningful error messages for different scenarios.
Exception responses are returned in a consistent format (e.g., JSON) for client-side handling.
Responsive User Interface:

The frontend is developed using React to provide a responsive and user-friendly interface.
UI components can be designed to display tasks, handle user interactions, and communicate with the backend API.
This project demonstrates the integration of Spring Boot, React, and JWT for secure user authentication and authorization in a task management system. It showcases various aspects of building a full-stack web application, including user registration, login, task management, role-based access control, and error handling.
